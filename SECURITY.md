# Security Policy for Repo-gnition

The Repo-gnition team and community take the security of our project seriously. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and our user community in helping us maintain a secure codebase.

## Supported Versions

We are committed to providing security updates for the following versions:
| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We have a responsible disclosure policy. **Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues**.

Instead, please report them directly to the project maintainer. To make a report, please take one of the following actions:

1. **Open a Private Security Advisory**: The preferred method is to use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature. You can do this by going to the "Security" tab of the repository and clicking "Report a vulnerability." This ensures the report is private and tracked securely.

2. **Email the Maintainer**: If you are unable to use GitHub's advisory system, please email the project maintainer directly using the contact information on their GitHub profile.

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us resolve the issue as quickly as possible, please provide a detailed report including:

- A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.

- The version of the project affected.

- Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability. This could include code snippets, proof-of-concept exploits, or a description of the setup.

- Any potential mitigations or workarounds you are aware of.

## Our Commitment

When you report a vulnerability, we will make every effort to:

1. **Acknowledge** your report within 48 hours.

2. Provide an initial **assessment** of the vulnerability's severity and impact within 72 hours.

3. Keep you informed of our **progress** as we work on a fix.

4. Publicly **credit** you for your discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous) once the vulnerability has been patched and a new version is released.

We are committed to addressing all security issues in a timely and responsible manner. Thank you for helping keep Repo-gnition secure.
